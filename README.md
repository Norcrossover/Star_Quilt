# Star_Quilt_Project
The program will be able to make a basic Star Quilt design through the Python Turtle module. I will have the user edit the colors of the "stitching," "background," and the "main color" of the quilt.

Pseudo Code:
The script will prompt the user for input for the primary and sub color.
Using that knowledge the building of the Star Quilt begins.
    Each Triangle had a lot of nested code which included:
        Using various algorithms to calculat exact points needed for where the cursor should be placed to draw all of the required designs.
        I used Sierpinski's Triangle, a rendition of Pascal's triangle to get a nice triangle design on each triangle of the hexagon. (triangle craze :O, Illuminati confirmed)
    The inner design was a freestyle... (assume I had an amazing algo to create it XD)

That's pretty much it, very artsy... Geometry from high school really came into play.
